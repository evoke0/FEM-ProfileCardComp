## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This has been my very first coding project. I tought my self basic HTML and CSS, and I wanted to try solving this. Building the HTML was really easy, but CSS was quite a challenge even though it is a newbie challenge.

The basic structure of CSS was no problem at all, including building the background and main container. However, positioning and giving some style to the content inside the main container was really a challenge that took me a few hours to solve, especially the social media content.

### Continued development

I aim to further develop my skills in doing responsive websites, since this one kind of breaks the background when playing with weird zoom or res. It is not perfect, but considering this was my first experience coding a website I think I did pretty good.

I loved playing with the z-index property, so I definitely want to do some responsive nav bars in the future.
